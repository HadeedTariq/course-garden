# Course Garden

## Overview

This is a modern course platform that provides a seamless experience for students and teachers, offering all essential functionalities such as course creation, enrollment, payments, feedback, and authentication.

## Features

### Authentication & User Roles
- **User Registration & Login**: Secure authentication system with JWT-based token management.
- **Role-Based Access**: Users can be students, teachers, or admins, each with specific privileges.
- **Token Refresh & Logout**: Secure session handling with refresh tokens.

### Course Management
- **Create & Publish Courses**: Teachers can create, manage, and publish courses.
- **Enroll in Courses**: Students can enroll in both free and paid courses.
- **Track Progress**: Completed chapters are stored and tracked.
- **Revenue Tracking**: Teachers can view earnings from their courses.

### Payment Integration (Challenge & Solution)
One challenge was handling payment webhooks, which are not compatible with serverless environments. The solution:
- **Custom Unique Payment ID System**
  - A unique transaction ID is generated and stored in the database before payment.
  - The frontend receives this ID and submits it during payment confirmation.
  - Instead of relying on webhooks, the backend validates the payment by checking the unique ID.
  - Ensures secure and reliable transaction processing without external webhooks.

### Course Interaction
- **Playlists**: Users can create and manage playlists.
- **Feedback & Reviews**: Students can provide feedback, and teachers can respond.
- **Notifications**: Users receive updates on course progress and announcements.

### Admin Dashboard
- **Teacher Approval System**: Users can request to become teachers; admins approve/reject requests.
- **Manage Users & Courses**: Admins oversee platform activities and user roles.
